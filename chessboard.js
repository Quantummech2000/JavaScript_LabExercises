/** JS file containing the Chess board Pattern
* 	-------------------------------------------------------------
*   We try to define a 2D Array which reads the input and output 
*   If the row+col sum is even print a * else print a White-Space
*	With this logic we can reduce the complexity of the program.
*	In order to make it universal -- portable to a matrix of size
*  	n, I will read the size of the array and calculete the sum of
*	the row and col index. After which we can decide if its a * 
*  	or a White-Space.
